# NextWork Web Application Project 🚀

This project is part of the **NextWork 7-Day DevOps Challenge**, where I deploy and manage a simple web application using cloud and DevOps tools like **EC2**, **Git**, **GitHub**, and **VSCode**.

## 📁 Project Structure

- 'index.jsp' – Main web page of the application.
- Hosted on an **Amazon EC2 instance**.
- Version-controlled using **Git** and pushed to a **GitHub repository**.

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- How to set up a GitHub repository to store and track code changes.
- Created and configured a local Git repo on an EC2 instance.
- Connected local and remote repositories.
- Generated and used a **GitHub personal access token** for secure authentication.
- Staged, committed, and pushed code changes from EC2 to GitHub.
- Verified updates on the cloud repo.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Amazon EC2 (Ubuntu instance)
- Git & GitHub
- VSCode (connected to EC2 via Remote SSH)
- Java (JSP-based web app)

## 📌 Purpose

This project was created to understand the fundamentals of Git-based version control, cloud VM instances, and basic web application deployment practices.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment.
- Host the application using a web server like Apache Tomcat.
- Introduce branching and collaboration workflows.
